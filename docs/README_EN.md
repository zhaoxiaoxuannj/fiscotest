FISCO BCOS (pronounced /ˈfɪskl bi:ˈkɒz/) is an enterprise-level financial blockchain platform developed and open-sourced by the Financial Services Blockchain Consortium (Shenzhen) "FISCO" led by WeBank. Its usability has been extensively tested through practical applications. So far, more than 300 digital benchmark applications have emerged, covering fields such as finance, healthcare, education, culture, and social governance, such as the Pearl River Delta Credit Chain, the Blockchain Service Network BSN, the People's Chain, the National Health and Medical Big Data Innovation Platform, the Guangdong-Hong Kong Health Code Cross-border Recognition System, and so on.

In a single-chain configuration, the performance TPS can reach 100k. It fully supports national encryption algorithms, domestic operating systems, and domestic CPU architecture. FISCO BCOS provides rich features includingcomprehensive parallel computing, blockchain file system, governance framework, and distributed storage.

## Version Information:

- Stable Version (for production environment): v3.2.3, version details can be found in [FISCO-BCOS v3.2.3 Release Notes](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v3.2.3).

- Latest Version (for experiencing new features): v3.6.0, version details can be found in [FISCO-BCOS v3.6.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v3.6.0).

## System Overview
The architecture of FISCO BCOS system consists of the basic layer, core layer, service layer, user layer, and access layer on the left-hand side, providing stable and secure blockchain underlying services. The middleware layer simplifies the process of managing the blockchain system through a visual interface. On the right-hand side, there are supporting components for development, operation, and security control, meeting the needs of different roles during the application implementation process. Meanwhile, privacy protection and cross-chain-related technology components are also provided to satisfy the application requirements in different scenarios.
